Support
=======

The code has been tested on Arduino Uno, Leonardo, and Mega with a WIZnet W5100 Ethernet module. Arduino Leonardo and Mega can handle at least 112 LEDs. Arduino Uno maxs out at 80+ LEDs.

ESP32
-----

There is experimental support for ESP32. There are some known issues with the board. From time to time, HTTP requests either never arrive or arrive with missing data. When this happens, you need to give it some time, and the board will eventually "wake up" after a few seconds.

You need a level shifter to connect the STRIP pin (3.3V) on ESP32 to the DATA pin (5V) of the strip. Personally, I put together a single channel version of [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) breakout board.

API
===

The web server accepts the following HTTP requests:
* `GET` request to `/`: Responds with a `Hello from Arduino Server` message.
* `GET` request to `/strip/status`: Responds with an `ON` or `OFF` message for the on/off state of the strip.
* `GET` request to `/strip/modes`: Responds with a comma separated list of the available modes.
* `GET` request to `/strip/mode`: Responds with the name of the active mode.
* `GET` request to `/strip/color`: Responds with a JSON representation of the color of the strip, e.g. `{"r":92,"g":34,"b":127}`.
* `PUT` request to `/strip/status/on`: Turns the strip on.
* `PUT` request to `/strip/status/off`: Turns the strip off.
* `PUT` request to `/strip/mode`: Updates the mode. The required data are the name of the mode and, if applicable, a time period in ms, e.g. `SCANNER 100`.
* `PUT` request to `/strip/color`: Updates the color of the strip. The data must be formatted as a JSON object, e.g. `{"r":48,"g":254,"b":176}`.

LED Strips
==========

Currently only the NeoPixel strips are supported. If you would like to add support for a different strip, you need to extend the `LedStripBase` class, create an instance of your `LedStripX` class, and pass its pointer to the `init` method of the server.

Modes
=====

Modes exist to support dynamic effects on the strips. The available modes are SINGLE_COLOR, SCANNER, RAINBOW and RAINBOW_CYCLE. If you are interested to add your own mode, you need to extend the `ModeBase` class, and since modes are handled by the server, you also need to update the `getModes` and `updateMode` methods of `ArduinoPixelServer`.
